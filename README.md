# EPITA-Spring-2017


The project MUST use the MVC design pattern. It will require two View Controllers, a Model and two Views.
The project MUST include the following characteristics: a splash screen, a main table view screen, and a
detail view screen.
Splash Screen
The Splash Screen will be done on the LaunchScreen.xib file that Xcode provides. It will contain your
name, your login and the name of the app. The name of the app can be anything you want it to be.
Main Table View Screen
The Main Screen will contain the following components:
• A UITableView to select the CITY
• A custom UITableViewCell with fields for the CITY and the current TEMPERATURE
All of this has to fit in a regular iPhone 7 sized screen.
Detail View Screen
The Detail View Screen will contain the following components:
• UITextFields to display the CITY name, the current TEMPERATURE
• A UIImageView with a picture of the city
Additional Requirements
The app should also meet the following requirements:
• An image should be used covering the entire background of the splash screen. A plain color or a
sober gradient is preferable.
• The app should have its own icon.
• The app name that is shown on the splash screen should match the name below the app screen
icon before opening the app.
ADVANCED IOS PROGRAMMING - EPITA
• The Main Screen view should not be left with a simple white background. Create a design that is
readable and uses color, but that isn’t jarring to the eyes.
• The app should always display the correct detail view for each cell. 


ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS (EXTRA CREDIT)
• App rotates when device rotates and elements are rearranged correctly.
• Autolayout implementation. Items will rearrange on the screen depending on which device it’s being
viewed on (Only consider iPhones).

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
• User can delete the data if he wants but the factory data will be loaded again.
